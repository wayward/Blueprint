   * but we might also want to use it as a String, as stored in the configuration.
   * We can always call URI#toString(), but there are situations when this conversion
   * is "lossy" (i.e. parsing "000.001" to Double and back), or when we don't need
   * a String at all but something entirely different.
   * As long as the types we need are those that Blueprint knows how to deserialize
   * from their common string representation, we can use runtime type hinting to
   * achieve the same effect while hiding all the boilerplate code.
   *
   * As an example, we can obtain the value of ``_state'' in three different types:
   *   String str   = cfg._state(String.class)   => String: "TRUE"
   *   boolean bool = cfg._state(Boolean.class)  => boolean: true
   *   _State state = cfg._State(_State.class)   => enum: _State.TRUE
   *
   * Note, though, that methods using runtime type hinting cannot be pre-validated,
   * hence using them may result in deserialization errors at the time of invocation.
   * If that is the case, a BlueprintException will be thrown.  This is a compromise
   * between strict type checking and flexibility.
   * Of course, if you don't use runtime type hints, no exceptions will be thrown.
