  /* Sometimes we want to be flexible and have access to a configuration item
  in two or more "type flavors".  For example, if we have a configuration key
  such as "remote.baseurl = http://foo:23/", is by its intended nature a URI,
  but we might also want to access it as a simple String object
  we're converting types to their String representations using toString(), but there are
  situations when the conversion between a type known to the configuration and our
  desired type isn't readily available.  As long as the types we need are those that
  Blueprint knows how to deserialize from their common string representation, we can use
  runtime type hinting to achieve the same effect while hiding all the boilerplate code.
  Here, we can obtain the value of ``_state'' in three different types:

    - cfg.<String>_state(String.class)  => String: "TRUE"
    - cfg.<Boolean>_state(Boolean.class)  => boolean: true
    - cfg.<_State>_State(_State.class)  => _State enum: _State.TRUE

  Note, though, that methods using runtime type hinting cannot be pre-validated.
  This may result in deserialization errors at the time of a method's invocation.
  If that is the case, a BlueprintException will be thrown.  This is a compromise
  between strict type checking and flexibility of use.  Of course, if you don't use
  runtime type hints, no exceptions will be thrown during use. */

  simultaneously on a method.  Annotation takes precedence over the return type,
  and runtime type hint trumps both.  Note, though, that no matter which type is
  determined to be the final required type for deserialization, it still has to be a
  subclass of the declaring method's return type. */
